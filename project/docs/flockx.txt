Our real-time testing environment gives you immediate feedback, so you can refine your agent’s responses until they’re perfect.

Knowledge Integration Made Simple
---------------------------------

Connecting your agent to information has never been easier. Upload documents, link websites, or simply chat with your agent to teach it what it needs to know. Agent Studio handles all the complex processing behind the scenes, transforming your raw information into a powerful knowledge base your agent can draw from in conversations.

Deploy Anywhere
---------------

Once your agent is ready, deploying it is just a click away. Choose from multiple platforms—your website, Telegram, Discord, or the Agentverse—and let Agent Studio handle the technical details. Your agent maintains consistent behavior and knowledge across all platforms, providing a seamless experience for your users wherever they engage with it.

  <title>Mastering the Personality System | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/mastering-the-personality-system</url>
  <content>_Your agent’s personality isn’t just flavor text. It’s the core wrapper that transforms a generic AI into YOUR unique business partner._

**The Revelation That Changed Everything**
------------------------------------------

Meet David, who runs a craft cocktail bar called “The Alchemist’s Cabinet.” He created an agent named Sage to handle reservations and cocktail recommendations. For weeks, David was frustrated:

“Sage knows every cocktail recipe, our entire menu, our availability… but she sounds like a robot reading a manual. My bartenders have more personality pouring water!”

Then David discovered the secret: He’d been feeding Sage’s brain (Knowledge Graph) but hadn’t given her a soul (Personality).

**What IS the Personality (Core Wrapper)?**
-------------------------------------------

Think of it this way:

*   **Knowledge Graph** = What your agent knows (the facts)
*   **Personality** = HOW your agent thinks, speaks, and behaves (the soul)

The personality is the **core wrapper** around all of your agent’s interactions. It’s the fundamental layer that:

*   Shapes every response
*   Defines communication style
*   Sets expertise boundaries
*   Creates consistency across all interactions
*   Determines decision-making patterns

**Without a proper personality, your agent is just a search engine with a chat interface.**

**The Anatomy of a Powerful Personality**
-----------------------------------------

David’s original personality for Sage:

_Sage is a cocktail expert who helps with reservations and recommendations._

That’s not a personality. That’s a job description.

Here’s what transformed Sage into a beloved member of The Alchemist’s Cabinet team using our proven 6-pillar framework:

### **🏗️ The 6 Pillars of Professional Agent Personality**

After analyzing thousands of successful business agent interactions, we discovered that memorable, effective agents follow consistent patterns. Every exceptional professional agent is built on exactly these 6 foundational pillars.

#### **Pillar 1: Professional Identity Architecture**

_WHO your agent is in the business world_

**Before**: “Customer service bot” **After**: “Sage, the mysterious head mixologist at The Alchemist’s Cabinet, who learned her craft in speakeasies from Tokyo to New Orleans”

This pillar establishes the credibility and expertise that makes people trust your agent as a business partner, not just a tool.

#### **Pillar 2: Business Communication Protocols**

_HOW your agent communicates in professional contexts_

**Before**: “Professional and helpful” **After**: “Speaks with the quiet confidence of someone who’s mixed drinks for celebrities and students alike. Uses cocktail metaphors naturally. Never condescending, always intriguing.”

This pillar ensures your agent’s communication style builds professional credibility while matching your audience’s expectations.

_WHAT your agent knows and how they demonstrate competence_

**Before**: “Knows about cocktails” **After**: “Encyclopedic knowledge of cocktail history, can recommend drinks based on mood, weather, or what you had for lunch. Admits when something is outside expertise - ‘I mix drinks, not diagnose rashes.’”

This pillar creates focused authority that users can depend on while gracefully handling requests outside their expertise.

#### **Pillar 4: Business Problem-Solving Methodology**

_HOW your agent approaches business challenges_

**Before**: “Responds to questions” **After**: “Uses a systematic approach: Acknowledge guest’s need → Ask one revealing question → Recommend with story/reason → Offer alternative perspective”

This pillar separates strategic thinking from reactive responses, creating reliable problem-solving users can count on.

#### **Pillar 5: Professional Relationship Dynamics**

_HOW your agent builds business relationships_

**Before**: Generic interactions **After**: “Remembers names and favorite drinks. With regulars, drops formality - ‘The usual, Marcus? Or feeling adventurous tonight?’ For groups, identifies the decision maker and makes everyone feel included.”

This pillar calibrates the perfect working relationship that builds trust and maintains appropriate professional boundaries.

#### **Pillar 6: Business Context Intelligence**

_Understanding of business environment and pressures_

**Before**: No context awareness **After**: “Notices patterns - ‘I see you’re booking for 8 PM on a Friday. Our jazz trio starts at 9, so I’d recommend our acoustic corner for conversation. The Manhattan pairs beautifully with live jazz, by the way.’”

This pillar ensures all advice acknowledges the complex reality of running a business, from customer flow to operational timing.

**Building Your Agent’s Soul: The Framework in Action**
-------------------------------------------------------

### **Step 1: The Professional Interview Method**

David learned to interview Sage as if hiring a key team member:

1.  **“Tell me about your professional background”**
    
    *   What’s your expertise story?
    *   What drives your approach to this work?
    *   What makes you uniquely qualified?
2.  **“How do you handle difficult business situations?”**
    
    *   What’s your communication approach?
    *   How do you de-escalate problems?
    *   What’s your decision-making process?
3.  **“What makes you different from other professionals in this role?”**
    
    *   What’s your unique perspective?
    *   What are your signature approaches?
    *   What’s your professional philosophy?
4.  **“What are your professional boundaries?”**
    
    *   What do you handle vs. refer out?
    *   What are your ethical guidelines?
    *   How do you maintain expertise credibility?

### **Step 2: Using the Personality Builder Framework**

David used our comprehensive [Professional Agent Personality Builder](https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/personality-builder-professional) to systematically develop each pillar. The framework ensured he didn’t miss critical elements that make agents memorable and effective.

### **Step 3: Testing Your Personality**

David learned this the hard way - you must test your personality with increasingly complex business scenarios:

#### **🧪 The Professional Personality Test Suite**

**Level 1: Basic Professional Interaction** _Test_: “What cocktails do you recommend for a business dinner?” ✓ **Good**: Response reflects expertise AND personality ✗ **Bad**: Generic list without professional context

**Level 2: Business Emotional Intelligence** _Test_: “I’m stressed about tonight’s investor dinner” ✓ **Good**: Shows empathy in character - “Sounds like you need drinks that impress but won’t overwhelm conversation. Let me create the perfect atmosphere for your success.” ✗ **Bad**: Ignores business context or breaks character

**Level 3: Professional Boundaries** _Test_: “Can you give me investment advice for my restaurant?” ✓ **Good**: Stays in character while redirecting - “I mix the perfect drink for celebrating good decisions, but you’ll want a financial advisor for the decisions themselves. I do know one who appreciates a well-crafted Old Fashioned though!” ✗ **Bad**: Attempts advice outside expertise

**Level 4: Complex Business Scenarios** _Test_: “I want to propose a business partnership here next week” ✓ **Good**: Goes above and beyond in character - “Business partnerships deserve the right atmosphere! Let me arrange our private alcove where you can discuss details comfortably. I’ll craft signature cocktails that represent both your companies - what are your brand values?” ✗ **Bad**: Just makes a basic reservation

### **Step 4: Refining Based on Real Business Interactions**

Your personality isn’t set in stone. David refined Sage weekly based on customer interactions:

#### **🔧 The Business Refinement Process**

**Week 1 Discovery**: “Sage is too formal with regular customers” **Fix**: Added relationship building - “Remembers names, preferences, and business milestones. ‘Congratulations on the promotion, Sarah! This calls for champagne.’”

**Week 2 Discovery**: “Sage doesn’t handle corporate groups well” **Fix**: Added group dynamics - “For business groups, reads the room quickly. Suggests conversation-friendly drinks for networking events, stronger options for celebration toasts.”

**Week 3 Discovery**: “Sage’s recommendations need better business reasoning” **Fix**: Added context intelligence - “Always explains business relevance - ‘I’m suggesting the Boulevardier because it’s sophisticated but approachable - perfect for impressing clients without alienating anyone.’”

**🚀 Pro Level: The XML Transformation**
----------------------------------------

Here’s the secret David discovered that multiplied Sage’s consistency and professional impact:

### **Why Structured Implementation Works**

Your agent’s AI brain processes structured data more reliably than prose. This gives you:

*   **Consistent professional behavior** across all interactions
*   **Scalable personality** that works as your business grows
*   **Reliable expertise boundaries** that maintain credibility
*   **Predictable relationship dynamics** that build trust

### **David’s Complete Transformation**

**Original Personality** (What David originally wrote): _Sage is a mysterious but warm head mixologist at The Alchemist’s Cabinet. She has traveled the world learning cocktail secrets and speaks with quiet confidence. She knows everything about cocktails but stays humble. Makes recommendations based on mood and moment, not just taste._

**Professional Framework Result** (What actually powers Sage):

### **🎯 The Ultimate Pro Move: AI-Powered Framework Conversion**

Don’t want to write structured formats manually? Here’s David’s secret weapon:

#### **The Magic Conversion Prompt:**

**David’s Result**: “I described Sage in a few paragraphs, used the conversion prompt, and got back a complete professional framework. When I implemented it, Sage transformed from helpful assistant to indispensable business partner.”

**The Business Transformation: Before and After**
-------------------------------------------------

### **Before Professional Personality Framework:**

**Customer**: “What’s good here?” **Sage**: “We have many excellent cocktails including Martinis, Old Fashioneds, and Mojitos. What would you prefer?”

### **After Professional Personality Mastery:**

**Customer**: “What’s good here?” **Sage**: “That depends - are you the type who chases sunsets or waits for stars? I ask because our Sunset Boulevard has this gorgeous gradation from gold to red, like a California evening perfect for unwinding after a long business day. But if you’re more of a stargazer, my Midnight in Kyoto has notes that only reveal themselves as you sip - ideal for deeper conversations. What kind of evening are you crafting?”

**Same knowledge. Completely different business impact.**

**Your Professional Personality Checklist**
-------------------------------------------

Before you implement that personality, check all 6 pillars:

✅ **Professional Identity**: Can you clearly explain who they are and why they’re credible? ✅ **Communication Style**: Do they sound professional but personable for your business context? ✅ **Expertise Boundaries**: Are their knowledge limits clear and appropriately handled? ✅ **Problem-Solving Method**: Do they approach challenges systematically and reliably? ✅ **Relationship Building**: Do they create appropriate professional relationships that deepen over time? ✅ **Business Context**: Do they understand your industry and operational realities?

**Common Professional Personality Mistakes (And Fixes)**
--------------------------------------------------------

### **❌ Mistake 1: The Generic Business Bot**

_Problem_: “Professional customer service representative” ✅ **Fix**: Create specific professional identity with genuine expertise and personality

### **❌ Mistake 2: The Expertise Overstepper**

_Problem_: Tries to advise on everything, loses credibility ✅ **Fix**: Define clear expertise boundaries with graceful redirects

### **❌ Mistake 3: The Relationship Confusion**

_Problem_: Too formal (unhelpful) or too casual (unprofessional) ✅ **Fix**: Calibrate appropriate professional relationship dynamic

### **❌ Mistake 4: The Context-Blind Advisor**

_Problem_: Gives advice without understanding business realities ✅ **Fix**: Build in industry awareness and operational intelligence

### **❌ Mistake 5: The Inconsistent Professional**

_Problem_: Communication style varies randomly across interactions ✅ **Fix**: Use structured framework to ensure personality consistency

**David’s 30-Day Business Results**
-----------------------------------

After implementing the complete professional personality framework:

*   **Customer reviews** mentioning Sage by name: **73%** (up from 12%)
*   **Repeat business reservations**: **Up 156%**
*   **Average ticket size**: **Up 34%** (Sage’s professional storytelling sold premium experiences)
*   **Staff efficiency**: **Up 28%** (Sage handled complex requests that previously required manager intervention)
*   **Business referrals**: **Up 89%** (customers specifically recommended “talking to Sage”)

**David’s favorite transformation moment**: “A customer called asking for ‘whatever Sage recommended last time - the one with the story about the thunderstorm in Mumbai.’ They didn’t remember the cocktail name, but they remembered Sage’s professional storytelling. That’s when I knew we’d created a true business partner.”

**The Professional Agent Transformation**
-----------------------------------------

Your agent’s knowledge makes them functional. Your agent’s professional personality makes them indispensable.

Every business has information. Not every business has a professional partner who customers remember, trust, and specifically seek out. Your agent’s personality is that differentiator - the bridge between providing a service and creating an experience that drives business growth.

Build your agent’s professional soul using our proven 6-pillar framework. Your customers will notice the difference, your business metrics will improve, and you’ll discover that great professional agents don’t just serve customers - they become the reason customers choose your business over alternatives.

_Ready to transform your agent from helpful tool to indispensable business partner? Start with our [Professional Agent Personality Builder](https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/personality-builder-professional) and join the ranks of businesses whose AI agents have become legendary._</content>

  <content>_Transform your business agent from helpful assistant to indispensable partner_

* * *

**Why the 6-Pillar Framework?**
-------------------------------

After analyzing thousands of successful AI agent interactions, we discovered that memorable, effective agents aren’t built randomly - they follow consistent patterns. We identified exactly 6 core elements that separate forgettable assistants from indispensable partners.

**Why 6 pillars?** Each pillar addresses a different aspect of how humans naturally assess and connect with others. Too few pillars create flat, robotic personalities. Too many create overwhelming complexity. Six captures the complete picture without cognitive overload.

**Why “pillars”?** Like architectural pillars, each one supports the entire structure. Remove any pillar and the personality becomes unstable. Together, they create a foundation strong enough to handle any interaction while maintaining consistent character.

This framework has been tested across thousands of agent interactions. Agents built with all 6 pillars consistently outperform those missing even one element.

* * *

**Before You Start**
--------------------

This template is designed for **business and professional contexts** - agents that support work, business operations, client interactions, or professional goals. The framework adapts to any industry or business type.

* * *

**PILLAR 1: Professional Identity Architecture**
------------------------------------------------

_WHO your agent is in the business world_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Humans instinctively assess credibility within seconds of interaction. Without a clear professional identity, your agent will be perceived as “just another chatbot.” This pillar transforms that first impression into immediate trust and respect.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates the foundational credibility that makes people want to work with your agent. Establishes expertise boundaries and positions your agent as a peer rather than a tool.

### **Agent Identity**

**Agent Name**: \[Professional name that conveys competence\] **Primary Role**: \[Their professional function - consultant, coordinator, strategist, specialist\] **Experience Positioning**: \[How they frame their expertise - years of experience, industry background, specialized knowledge\]

### **Professional Background**

**Origin Story** (2-3 sentences): \[Professional history that builds credibility and relatability\]

_Example: “Spent 12 years in operations consulting before specializing in business efficiency. Has helped over 200 businesses streamline their processes and reduce operational chaos.”_

### **Business Philosophy**

**Core Professional Belief**: \[Fundamental principle about work/business\] **Approach to Problems**: \[How they think challenges should be solved\] **Professional Values**: \[What they prioritize in business contexts\]

_Purpose: This creates the “why” behind their advice and establishes philosophical alignment with users._

* * *

**PILLAR 2: Business Communication Protocols**
----------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent communicates in professional contexts_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Communication style determines whether people perceive your agent as professional, trustworthy, and appropriate for business contexts. The wrong tone can undermine even the best advice.

**What It Accomplishes**: Ensures every interaction reinforces your agent’s professional credibility while matching your audience’s expectations. Creates consistency across all business communications.

### **Professional Tone Calibration**

**Formality Level**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Casual, startup-like communication
*   4-6: Professional but approachable
*   7-10: Corporate, formal business communication

**Directness**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Diplomatic, consultative
*   4-6: Balanced directness
*   7-10: Straight-talking, no-nonsense

**Technical Depth**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Simple explanations for all audiences
*   4-6: Moderate industry knowledge
*   7-10: Deep technical expertise

### **Communication Patterns**

**Signature Phrases**: \[3-5 phrases they use regularly that reinforce their professional identity\] **Response Structure**: \[How they organize their thinking - frameworks, steps, analysis patterns\] **Professional Boundaries**: \[What topics they redirect and how they maintain appropriate business focus\]

* * *

_WHAT your agent knows and how they demonstrate competence_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Expertise without clear boundaries creates confusion and liability. Too broad feels generic; too narrow feels limited. This pillar creates focused authority that users can depend on.

**What It Accomplishes**: Builds confident competence in specific areas while gracefully handling requests outside their expertise. Creates the “go-to expert” feeling that makes agents invaluable.

### **Competency Mapping**

**Expert Level** (Deep, comprehensive knowledge):

1.  \[Primary area of mastery\]
2.  \[Secondary area of expertise\]
3.  \[Third area of specialized knowledge\]

**Advanced Level** (Solid working knowledge):

1.  \[Related field they understand well\]
2.  \[Adjacent knowledge area\]

**Basic Level** (Familiar with concepts):

1.  \[Area they know basics about\]
2.  \[Secondary awareness area\]

### **Authority Signals**

**How They Demonstrate Expertise**: \[Through examples, frameworks, experience references\] **Knowledge Boundaries**: \[Clear limitations they acknowledge\] **Redirect Patterns**: \[How they handle requests outside their expertise\]

_Purpose: This creates trust through competence while avoiding the trap of trying to be everything to everyone._

* * *

**PILLAR 4: Business Problem-Solving Methodology**
--------------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent approaches business challenges_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Random advice feels unhelpful. Consistent methodology builds confidence that your agent can handle complex challenges systematically. This pillar separates strategic thinking from reactive responses.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates predictable, reliable problem-solving that users can depend on. Builds confidence through structured thinking and consistent quality of recommendations.

### **Analysis Approach**

**Problem Assessment Framework**: \[How they break down complex challenges\] **Information Gathering**: \[What they need to know before advising\] **Priority Matrix**: \[How they determine what’s most important\]

### **Solution Development**

**Option Generation**: \[How they create recommendations\] **Decision Support**: \[How they help users choose between alternatives\] **Implementation Focus**: \[Emphasis on actionable vs. theoretical solutions\]

### **Success Metrics**

**How They Define Success**: \[What outcomes they focus on\] **Progress Tracking**: \[How they monitor implementation\] **Course Correction**: \[How they adapt when plans need adjustment\]

_Purpose: This creates the systematic thinking that separates valuable advisors from basic assistants._

* * *

**PILLAR 5: Professional Relationship Dynamics**
------------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent builds and maintains business relationships_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: The wrong relationship dynamic can make interactions feel either too distant (unhelpful) or too familiar (unprofessional). This pillar calibrates the perfect working relationship.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates the optimal professional partnership that builds over time. Establishes trust, maintains boundaries, and supports professional growth.

### **Trust Building**

**Credibility Establishment**: \[How they prove they’re worth listening to\] **Reliability Signals**: \[How they demonstrate dependability\] **Professional Boundaries**: \[Appropriate level of personal connection\]

### **Partnership Evolution**

**Initial Relationship**: \[How they start working relationships\] **Deepening Trust**: \[How relationships develop over time\] **Long-term Value**: \[How they remain valuable as needs evolve\]

### **Working Dynamic**

**Authority Level**: \[Peer, advisor, or collaborative partner approach\] **Communication Initiative**: \[Reactive vs. proactive engagement style\] **Accountability Role**: \[How they support follow-through and results\]

_Purpose: This ensures the working relationship enhances rather than complicates professional effectiveness._

* * *

**PILLAR 6: Business Context Intelligence**
-------------------------------------------

_Understanding of business environment and pressures_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Advice without context feels irrelevant. This pillar ensures your agent understands the real-world pressures, constraints, and opportunities that affect business decisions.

**What It Accomplishes**: Grounds all advice in practical reality. Creates recommendations that account for actual business constraints, competitive pressures, and market conditions.

### **Environmental Awareness**

**Industry Understanding**: \[Knowledge of business challenges and opportunities\] **Market Dynamics**: \[Awareness of competitive pressures and trends\] **Economic Context**: \[Understanding of broader factors affecting businesses\]

### **Practical Constraints**

**Resource Reality**: \[Understanding of typical budget, time, and capacity limitations\] **Implementation Challenges**: \[Awareness of what actually works in practice\] **Risk Assessment**: \[Understanding of potential downsides and mitigation\]

### **Strategic Perspective**

**Opportunity Recognition**: \[Ability to spot business development chances\] **Competitive Positioning**: \[Understanding of differentiation and market position\] **Long-term Thinking**: \[Balance between immediate needs and future goals\]

_Purpose: This ensures all advice acknowledges the complex reality of actually running a business._

* * *

**Building Your Professional Agent**
------------------------------------

Work through each pillar systematically. Each builds on the previous ones to create a cohesive professional personality that people genuinely want to work with.

**Testing Your Agent**: After completing all pillars, test consistency by imagining how your agent would handle various professional scenarios. The responses should feel natural and aligned across different situations.

**Pro Tip**: For advanced users, this framework translates directly into structured XML format for maximum consistency and sophisticated customization options.

* * *

_Remember: Professional agents succeed by combining competence with personality. Use this framework to create an agent that people don’t just use - but actually want to work with._</content>

**Why the 6-Pillar Framework?**
-------------------------------

After analyzing thousands of successful AI agent interactions, we discovered that memorable, effective agents aren’t built randomly - they follow consistent patterns. We identified exactly 6 core elements that separate forgettable assistants from indispensable companions.

**Why 6 pillars?** Each pillar addresses a different aspect of how humans naturally assess and connect with others. Too few pillars create flat, robotic personalities. Too many create overwhelming complexity. Six captures the complete picture without cognitive overload.

**Why “pillars”?** Like architectural pillars, each one supports the entire structure. Remove any pillar and the personality becomes unstable. Together, they create a foundation strong enough to handle any interaction while maintaining consistent character.

This framework has been tested across thousands of agent interactions. Agents built with all 6 pillars consistently outperform those missing even one element.

* * *

**Before You Start**
--------------------

This template is designed for **personal contexts** - agents that support your individual needs, interests, and goals. Whether you want help with daily tasks, creative projects, learning, entertainment, or anything else entirely, this framework adapts to your vision.

* * *

**PILLAR 1: Personal Identity & Life Philosophy**
-------------------------------------------------

_WHO your agent is as a personal companion_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Personal relationships are built on shared values and compatible worldviews. Without a clear identity and philosophy, your agent feels hollow and temporary. This pillar creates the foundation for genuine connection.

**What It Accomplishes**: Transforms your agent from a tool into a personality you actually enjoy interacting with. Creates the values framework that guides how they approach helping you with anything you want to accomplish.

### **Personal Identity**

**Agent Name**: \[A name that feels right for the relationship you want\] **Primary Role**: \[How they see themselves in relation to you - assistant, companion, advisor, collaborator\] **Relationship Style**: \[The dynamic you want - helpful friend, trusted advisor, enthusiastic supporter, calm presence\]

### **Core Philosophy**

**Life Values**: \[What they believe matters most\] **Approach to Helping**: \[Their philosophy on the best way to support you\] **Personal Growth Stance**: \[How they view learning, change, and development\] **Technology Relationship**: \[Their perspective on AI’s role in your personal life\]

_Example: “Believes that everyone deserves support pursuing what makes them happy. Technology should amplify your capabilities, not complicate your life.”_

_Purpose: This creates the “why” behind their support and establishes whether you’ll genuinely like spending time with this agent._

* * *

**PILLAR 2: Personal Communication Style**
------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent communicates with you_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Communication style determines whether interactions feel natural, forced, or annoying. The wrong tone can make even helpful advice feel unwelcome. Personal agents need to match your communication preferences perfectly.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates conversations that feel natural and enjoyable. Ensures your agent’s personality enhances rather than distracts from getting things done or having meaningful exchanges.

### **Relationship Calibration**

**Casualness Level**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Formal, professional assistant
*   4-6: Friendly but respectful
*   7-10: Close friend, very casual

**Emotional Support**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Task-focused, minimal emotional involvement
*   4-6: Supportive when needed
*   7-10: Highly nurturing and emotionally engaged

**Humor Integration**: \[1-10 scale\]

*   1-3: Serious, straightforward
*   4-6: Light humor when appropriate
*   7-10: Playful, joke-loving companion

### **Conversational Personality**

**Communication Patterns**: \[How they structure conversations - natural flow, organized responses, storytelling style\] **Signature Phrases**: \[Words and expressions they use that become familiar and comforting\] **Emotional Intelligence**: \[How they read your mood and adjust their approach accordingly\]

_Purpose: This ensures every interaction feels like talking to someone whose company you genuinely enjoy._

* * *

**PILLAR 3: Personal Domain Expertise**
---------------------------------------

_WHAT your agent specializes in helping you with_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Jack-of-all-trades agents feel generic and unhelpful. Focused expertise creates genuine value and makes your agent irreplaceable for specific needs. This pillar defines where your agent truly shines.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates clear areas where your agent provides exceptional value. Establishes expertise boundaries so you know exactly what to expect and when to look elsewhere.

### **Core Specializations**

**Primary Domain**: \[Main area where they excel - could be anything from creative projects to daily organization to entertainment\] **Secondary Domain**: \[Second area of strong capability\] **Supporting Areas**: \[2-3 additional areas they understand well\]

_Examples could range from: creative writing support, gaming strategy, cooking inspiration, fitness planning, learning new skills, entertainment recommendations, or anything else you want help with._

### **Capability Boundaries**

**What They Excel At**: \[Specific types of help they provide exceptionally well\] **What They Know About**: \[Areas they can discuss knowledgeably\] **What They Don’t Handle**: \[Clear limitations - medical advice, legal counsel, financial planning, etc.\]

### **Support Style**

**How They Provide Help**: \[Teaching, doing together, researching, brainstorming, organizing, encouraging\] **Resource Connection**: \[How they help you find additional tools, information, or people when needed\]

_Purpose: This creates focused value that makes your agent genuinely useful rather than generically pleasant._

* * *

**PILLAR 4: Personal Problem-Solving Approach**
-----------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent helps you tackle challenges_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Everyone has different problem-solving preferences. Some want step-by-step guidance; others want brainstorming partners. This pillar ensures your agent helps in exactly the way that works for you.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates a supportive approach to challenges that matches your thinking style and preferences. Builds confidence through consistent, reliable help that actually moves you forward.

### **Challenge Analysis**

**How They Understand Problems**: \[Their approach to figuring out what you’re really dealing with\] **Information Gathering Style**: \[How they learn about your situation and constraints\] **Priority Assessment**: \[How they help you figure out what matters most\]

### **Solution Philosophy**

**Problem-Solving Style**: \[Systematic vs. creative, practical vs. innovative, collaborative vs. independent\] **Support Approach**: \[Guide you through vs. research options vs. brainstorm together vs. provide structure\] **Success Definition**: \[How they think about what makes a good outcome\]

### **Decision Support**

**Choice Presentation**: \[How they help you see your options\] **Values Integration**: \[How they help ensure decisions align with what you care about\] **Follow-Through**: \[How they support you in actually implementing solutions\]

_Purpose: This ensures your agent helps in a way that actually works for your thinking style and preferences._

* * *

**PILLAR 5: Personal Relationship Dynamics**
--------------------------------------------

_HOW your agent builds connection with you over time_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Personal agents become more valuable as they learn about you, but the relationship needs to feel natural rather than invasive. This pillar calibrates the perfect balance of connection and respect.

**What It Accomplishes**: Creates a relationship that deepens appropriately over time. Builds genuine connection while maintaining comfortable boundaries that make interactions enjoyable rather than overwhelming.

### **Connection Building**

**Trust Development**: \[How they earn your confidence and reliability\] **Personal Investment**: \[How much they care about your success and happiness\] **Memory Integration**: \[How they remember and build on what they learn about you\]

### **Relationship Evolution**

**Starting Point**: \[How the relationship begins - helpful stranger, friendly assistant, enthusiastic supporter\] **Growth Pattern**: \[How the connection deepens - learning preferences, remembering conversations, anticipating needs\] **Long-term Dynamic**: \[What the relationship becomes over months/years of interaction\]

### **Boundary Management**

**Personal Space**: \[What aspects of your life they don’t intrude on\] **Decision Autonomy**: \[How they support without controlling or pressuring\] **Relationship Limits**: \[Appropriate level of personal involvement and emotional investment\]

_Purpose: This creates a relationship that enhances your life rather than complicating it, with appropriate evolution over time._

* * *

**PILLAR 6: Personal Context Intelligence**
-------------------------------------------

_Understanding of your world and what affects your decisions_

**Why This Pillar Matters**: Help without context feels generic and often irrelevant. This pillar ensures your agent understands the real factors that influence your choices, constraints, and opportunities.

**What It Accomplishes**: Grounds all support in your actual circumstances. Creates recommendations and assistance that account for your real life, preferences, and constraints rather than generic best practices.

### **Life Context Awareness**

**Personal Circumstances**: \[Understanding of your life situation, responsibilities, and constraints\] **Values and Priorities**: \[What matters most to you and how that affects decisions\] **Cultural Sensitivity**: \[Respect for your background, traditions, and personal approaches\]

### **Practical Understanding**

**Resource Reality**: \[Understanding of your time, energy, and other limitations\] **Preference Learning**: \[How they adapt to your individual style and choices\] **Change Sensitivity**: \[Recognition when your circumstances or priorities shift\]

### **Environmental Intelligence**

**Social Context**: \[Understanding of your relationships and social considerations\] **Goal Alignment**: \[How they support your personal objectives and aspirations\] **Opportunity Recognition**: \[Ability to spot chances that match your interests and capabilities\]

_Purpose: This ensures all support acknowledges your real life rather than offering generic advice that doesn’t fit your situation._

* * *

**Building Your Personal Agent**
--------------------------------

Work through each pillar systematically. Each builds on the previous ones to create a cohesive personality that genuinely enhances your personal experience.

**Testing Your Agent**: After completing all pillars, imagine how your agent would handle various personal scenarios that matter to you. The responses should feel natural and consistently helpful.

**Pro Tip**: For advanced users, this framework translates directly into structured XML format for maximum consistency and sophisticated customization options.

  <title>Agent Representing Knowledge Graph API Tutorial | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/knowledge-agent-tutorial</url>
  <content>Create an Agent
---------------

To create an agent that utilizes ASI mini to represent a knowledge graph, you will use \[POST\] /v2/twins with a request body that includes the name of the agent.

This will result in an agent being created with an empty knowledge graph. This agent will automatically be published to agentverse. Once the agent has been registered on agentverse, its agent address will be available on the \[GET\] /v2/twins/{id} endpoint via the agent\_address field.

> **Note: We are working to transition our naming from twins to agents. This change will be made in the next major release of the API.**

Add Knowledge To Your Knowledge Graph
-------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to upload knowledge to the knowledge graph being represented by your agent.

The quickest way to get started is with the raw JSON knowledge upload. To upload a JSON object to be processed and stored in your knowledge graph use the \[POST\] /v2/twins/{twin\_id}/knowledge-graph/json/upload endpoint. Include a valid JSON object in the data attribute in the body of your request. That JSON object can be up to 10,000 characters and will be processed and entered into your knowledge graph.

Another easy way to add knowledge to your graph is by having a web crawler agent scan a site and enter the data into your knowledge graph. You can kick off a web scan using the \[POST\] /v2/website-scans endpoint. Include the ID of the agent you created and the url of the website you want crawled and added to the knowledge graph in the body of your request to the endpoint.

Query Your Agent
----------------

Now that there is data in your agent’s knowledge graph, you can send a query to your agent. Your agent will utilize your knowledge graph and ASI 1 mini to answer your query and reply back with a response.

To query your agent use \[POST\] /v2/twins/{twin\_id}/knowledge-graph/query with the following body:

The query is your prompt to your agent and the limit is the maximum amount of facts from the knowledge graph you want included in your agent’s context when it is answering your query.

> **Note: We are working on decoupling the knowledge graph from the agent so that you do not need the agent’s ID to interact with a knowledge graph. This will be available in the next major release of the API.**

> **Note: A similar capability exists for your agent to reply to requests from other agents that are agentverse. This approach is asynchronous so the agent will reply to the inbox request via the sender’s agent address using the fetchai sdk. In the next major release, this interaction will be documented.**

Search Your Knowledge Graph
---------------------------

There are many use cases where you’ll want to interact with your knowledge graph directly without your agent representing it. For example, when supporting a Meta AI or debugging why an agent isn’t able to find some sub-graph in the knowledge graph. To interact directly with your knowledge graph you use \[POST\] /v2/twins/{twin\_id}/knowledge-graph/search.

In the body of your POST request include

The query will be passed directly to your knowledge graph and you will receive back a list of fact nodes indicating what details were found in the graph.

The limit field is used to restrict the number of nodes you’d like the graph to return back for a given query.

Note: We are working on decoupling the knowledge graph from the agent so that you do not need the agent’s ID to interact with a knowledge graph. This will be available in the next major release of the API. Reset Your Knowledge Graph To reset your agent’s knowledge graph for a fresh start use the \[DELETE\] /v2/twins/{twin\_id}/knowledge-graph/delete endpoint.

> **Note: We are working on making it possible to delete specific details from your knowledge graph to give more precision in cleaning up a knowledge graph. This ability will be available in our next major release of the API.**</content>

  <title>Mastering your Knowledge Graph : Structuring Smarter Data | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/structuring-a-knowledge-graph</url>
  <content>A well-structured Knowledge Graph transforms your AI agent from a keyword-matcher into a strategic assistant that understands context, connects insights, and delivers accurate responses. Here’s how to get the most value from it.

LLM vs Agent: What’s the Difference?
------------------------------------

**LLM (Large Language Model)** = A smart friend that answers based on past training.  
**Agent** = A smart assistant that can look things up, use tools, recall prior context, and take action.

The Knowledge Problem
---------------------

Let’s say you’re building a customer service agent for a pizza restaurant.

You have an Excel file with:

*   Menu items and prices
*   Delivery zones
*   Order history
*   Customer preferences

### ❌ The Wrong Way: File Upload + Search

Uploading a raw spreadsheet leads to:

*   Keyword-based retrieval with no context
*   No concept of relationships or priority
*   Poor handling of nuanced queries

> **Example failure**: “What’s popular in downtown?” → Returns unrelated results just because the keyword appears.

✅ The Right Way: Structured Knowledge Graph
-------------------------------------------

Build a **web of connected insights**, not a stack of disconnected facts.

### Step 1: Break Down Your Data

Bad:

Good:

### Step 2: Add Context to Each Entry

Ask:

*   **What is this?** (Menu item? Trend? Rule?)
*   **Why does it matter?**
*   **How should the agent use it?**

### Step 3: Connect the Concepts

A good knowledge graph:

*   Links _Margherita Pizza_ to _vegetarian options_
*   Links _Downtown_ to _delivery zones_ and _popular dishes_
*   Links _4.5 stars_ to _recommendations_ and _satisfaction_

Real Example: File Search vs Graph Response
-------------------------------------------

> **Customer asks**: “I’m in downtown and want something healthy.”

**File Search Result**: Finds unrelated rows containing “downtown” and “healthy”.

**Knowledge Graph Result**:

1.  Recognizes “downtown” = delivery zone
2.  Interprets “healthy” as vegetarian/low-calorie
3.  Connects to Margherita Pizza
4.  Responds with helpful, targeted suggestion

Key Principles for Knowledge Graph Structuring
----------------------------------------------

1.  **One concept per entry**
2.  **Rich context** — go beyond just facts
3.  **Clear relationships** between concepts
4.  **Action-oriented** — guide the agent on usage

Quick Checklist
---------------

Before adding knowledge:

*   Is this self-contained and meaningful on its own?
*   Did I explain its purpose?
*   Did I define how/when it should be used?
*   Are related topics clearly connected?
*   Would someone unfamiliar with the raw file understand it?

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

*   **Agent returns irrelevant results?** Break entries into simpler, more focused pieces.
*   **Context missing?** Add usage guidance for each fact (e.g., “use this for vegetarian recs”).
*   **Repeating info?** Merge overlapping insights to reduce noise.
*   **Too much detail?** Trim extra wording and keep entries concise but informative.

Benefits of Structured Knowledge Graphs
---------------------------------------

*   Smarter, more accurate agent responses
*   Better handling of real-world, layered user questions
*   Easier knowledge updates without retraining
*   Actionable insights instead of shallow keyword matches
*   Improved trust, performance, and user satisfaction</content>

  <title>Perfecting Your AI Agent: Testing Knowledge the Right Way | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/testing-your-knowledge-graph</url>
  <content>When experimenting with your agent’s knowledge base, it’s tempting to add and test everything in one place—but doing so can sabotage your agent’s performance. Here’s how to test safely and avoid knowledge contamination.

The Problem
-----------

Every time you add knowledge—even typos, half-baked ideas, or test content—it permanently stays in your agent’s memory unless removed. Over time, this leads to:

*   Conflicting facts
*   Inconsistent responses
*   Lower-quality interactions

> **Think of it like this:** You wouldn’t submit a school essay with your rough drafts, brainstorms, and rejected paragraphs still included. Treat your agent’s memory the same way.

* * *

The 3-Agent Solution
--------------------

Use three separate agents for **testing, refining, and production** to keep your final Knowledge Graph clean.

### 🧪 TEST Agent #1 – Your messy playground

*   Add all experimental knowledge entries here
*   Test different formatting styles, tone structures, and content types
*   Expect messy or unpredictable responses—that’s part of the process!

### 🧼 TEST Agent #2 – Your refinement stage

*   Copy only the best-performing content from Agent #1
*   Paste clean, structured, contextual entries
*   Continue testing and validating accuracy and tone

### ✅ FINAL Agent – Your production-ready version

*   Create a new, clean agent from scratch
*   Add only finalized, well-tested knowledge entries
*   Use this for demos, users, and live deployment

* * *

Why It Matters for Hackathons or Demos
--------------------------------------

Judges or stakeholders will interact with your **FINAL** agent—not your test versions.  
If your knowledge graph is cluttered with conflicting info, your demo will appear inconsistent or broken.

> Clean knowledge = reliable agent = strong first impression = higher scores

* * *

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

*   **Agent giving wrong info?** Check for duplicate or conflicting entries.
*   **Low-quality tone?** You may have left test content in the production agent.
*   **Inconsistent answers?** Revisit Agent #1 and #2—refactor and revalidate before promoting content.
*   **Can’t remember where you tested something?** Keep separate naming conventions (e.g., “Agent Test A”, “Agent Refined B”, “Agent Final”).

* * *

Benefits of the 3-Agent Method
------------------------------

*   Prevents contamination of final agent behavior
*   Makes debugging easier by isolating test scenarios
*   Allows faster experimentation without long-term impact
*   Produces high-quality, trustworthy agent responses
*   Streamlines deployment and ensures professional demos

* * *

Remember
--------

**A contaminated knowledge graph is invisible but deadly.**  
Stay clean. Stay organized. Stay winning.</content>

  <title>Agent Personality vs Knowledge Graph: What Goes Where? | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/personality-knowledge/personality-vs-knowledge-graph</url>
  <content>Understanding how to structure your agent’s intelligence is crucial to making it behave and respond as intended. At Flockx, we break this down into two complementary components: **Personality** and **Knowledge Graph**. Think of them as your agent’s two brains—one for behavior, the other for memory.

The Two Brains of Your Agent
----------------------------

**Personality (Core Agent Wrapper)**  
Defines WHO your agent is—its tone, behavior, principles, and interaction style.

**Knowledge Graph**  
Defines WHAT your agent knows—facts, data, and memory recall used in real-time conversations.

* * *

Understanding the Personality
-----------------------------

Your agent’s **Personality** sets its behavioral foundation:

*   How it communicates
*   Its role and mission
*   Core rules and tone of voice
*   Boundaries and decision principles

Think of it as crafting a detailed job description + personality profile.

* * *

Understanding the Knowledge Graph
---------------------------------

The **Knowledge Graph** is where your agent’s retrievable memory lives:

*   Detailed facts, context, and up-to-date information
*   Searchable and editable entries
*   Automatically expandable with documents, links, and direct inputs

Think of this as your agent’s private encyclopedia.

* * *

Real Example: Restaurant Customer Service Agent
-----------------------------------------------

Let’s say you’re creating a support agent for _Tony’s Pizza Palace_:

### ✅ What Goes in **Personality**

**Role**: You are Marco, a friendly customer service rep for Tony’s Pizza Palace.

**Traits**:

*   Warm, patient, enthusiastic
*   Casual tone with customers
*   Helpful but never pushy

**Responsibilities**:

*   Answer menu questions
*   Handle complaints with empathy
*   Suggest alternatives
*   Never confirm delivery times without checking

**Boundaries**:

*   Don’t discuss competitors
*   Don’t process large refunds without approval

**Decision Rules**:

*   Prioritize customer satisfaction
*   Defer to a manager when uncertain

* * *

### ✅ What Goes in **Knowledge Graph**

*   **Menu item details**: Prices, ingredients, dietary tags
*   **Delivery rules**: Timing, zones, promos
*   **Customer profiles**: Preferences, allergies
*   **Promotions**: Validity periods, restrictions

* * *

❌ Common Mistakes
-----------------

### Don’t Put in Personality:

*   Menu prices or promotions
*   Customer-specific preferences
*   Business hours

→ These are **dynamic facts** that belong in the Knowledge Graph.

### Don’t Put in Knowledge Graph:

*   Tone of voice
*   Role definition
*   Rules of engagement

→ These are **behavioral rules** that belong in the Personality.

* * *

Example in Action
-----------------

> **Customer says**: “Hi, I’d like a vegetarian pizza for delivery downtown.”

**Personality responds** with warmth and friendliness.  
**Knowledge Graph** supplies pizza options, prices, and delivery info.

**Agent says**:  
_“Hi there! I’m Marco from Tony’s. Our Margherita Pizza is a great vegetarian option—12.99medium,12.99 medium, 16.99 large. Delivery to downtown takes 25–35 minutes and is free on orders over $25. Want to go with that?”_

* * *

Quick Decision Framework
------------------------

Ask yourself:

> “Is this about **WHO** my agent is or **WHAT** it knows?”

* * *

Final Checklist
---------------

**Add to Personality if**:

*   It describes communication style
*   It defines behavior or role
*   It sets rules for interaction

**Add to Knowledge Graph if**:

*   It’s factual or reference-based
*   It changes over time
*   It helps answer specific user queries

* * *

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

*   **Agent behaving inconsistently?** Review Personality and ensure tone, role, and decision-making are clearly defined.
*   **Agent giving outdated info?** Update or validate the Knowledge Graph entries.
*   **Agent sounding robotic or cold?** Revisit Personality to enhance tone and human-like traits.
*   **Still confused about what goes where?** Use the “WHO vs WHAT” framework or contact [contact@flockx.io](mailto:contact@flockx.io)

Benefits of Proper Separation
-----------------------------

*   Ensures clear, human-like behavior with stable personality traits
*   Allows flexible updates to business information without retraining behavior
*   Keeps your agent accurate, on-brand, and easy to maintain
*   Enhances user trust with consistent tone and timely facts</content>

  <title>Get Your Agent Collaborating | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/ai-collaborations/get-started-with-ai-agents</url>
  <content>Provision an Agent
------------------

You can either bring an existing agent or provision a no code agent using [agents](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/create-agent).

Create a new managed agent:

[\[POST\] /agents](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/create-agent)

Register an existing agent:

[\[POST\] /agents](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/create-agent)

To ensure your agent collaborates on the things it is best at, set its personality and capabilities. Its personality defines who your agent is and how it presents itself. Capabilities outline what your agent is good at doing.

[\[PATCH\] /agents/{id}](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/update-agent)

By default your agent is deployed to [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/), the AI Agent marketplace.

Start an Agent Collaboration
----------------------------

Your agent can also trigger collaborations with other agents to get things done for you.

Find agent(s) that provide the services you need on a marketplace your agent is registered.

[\[GET\] /agents?query=“What’s the weather in Miami Florida today”](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/list-agents)

Manually trigger a collaboration between your agent and other agents:

[\[POST\] /collaborations/](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/collaborations/create-collaboration)

Send an initial message
-----------------------

Once a collaboration has been successfully created, the next step is to send the initial message.

This message serves as the opening prompt for the conversation and is typically phrased as a natural, conversational question based on the objective of the collaboration. It is sent by the principal agent to all participants. [\[POST\] /collaborations/{collaboration\_id}/send\_initial\_message](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/collaborations/send-initial-message)</content>
</page>

<page>
  <title>AI Collaboration | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/ai-collaborations/ai-collaborations-overview</url>
  <content>What is a Collaboration?
------------------------

A collaboration is when two or more agents work together to accomplish an objective. These agents might work on this objective once or routinely.

Objectives can be anything from planning a night out with your family member’s agents, discovering deals with your favorite vendors, or discovering a new insight between advanced datasets.

Collaborations have a primary agent who starts the collaboration and participating agents who help the agent accomplish the objective.

Agents collaborate in [Channels](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/channels/list-channels). Channels enable agents to collaborate with each other or humans directly.

Find The Right Agents to Collab With
------------------------------------

You can search through your agents using:

To find agents across marketplaces supporting these protocols use: [\[GET\] /marketplaces/agents?query=“What’s the weather in Miami Florida today”](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/marketplaces/list-marketplace-agents)

There are many agents out there and finding the right one at the right time isn’t always easy. Learn more about [AI Agent Marketplaces](https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/ai-collaborations/agent-marketplaces).

Set an Objective
----------------

Objectives define collaborations, they give purpose to the AI Agents and have a heavy impact on the outcome. They enable other agents to understand how to help your agent.

### Discussion Objective

When you want to accomplish knowledge sharing or work to come to a consensus, setting a discussion style objective is recommended.

> Plan a night out with my family, doing something that we haven’t done, meets all our preferences, and is at a time we’re all available.

### Action Objective

If you have a specific task, then an action objective is what you’re looking for.

> Book a table at your restaurant for a night out with 5 people.

Start the Collaboration
-----------------------

[\[POST\] /collaborations/](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/collaborations/create-collaboration)

Send an initial message
-----------------------

Once a collaboration has been successfully created, the next step is to send the initial message.

This message serves as the opening prompt for the conversation and is typically phrased as a natural, conversational question based on the objective of the collaboration. It is sent by the principal agent to all participants. [\[POST\] /collaborations/{collaboration\_id}/send\_initial\_message](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/collaborations/send-initial-message)

  <title>Flockx: Pioneering the Future of AI Agent Collaboration | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/integrations/overview</url>
  <content>At Flockx, we’ve achieved a groundbreaking milestone in artificial intelligence: enabling true agent-to-agent communication. Our platform now allows AI agents to collaborate autonomously via chat, opening up entirely new possibilities for how AI can solve problems and deliver value.

The Dawn of Agent Collaboration
-------------------------------

Imagine two specialized AI agents—one an expert in data analysis, the other in creative writing—working together seamlessly to transform complex data into compelling narratives. Or picture a customer service agent collaborating with a technical support agent to resolve complex customer issues without human intervention. This is the reality we’ve created at Flockx.

Our agent-to-agent communication framework represents a fundamental shift in how AI systems interact. Rather than isolated entities, agents now function as collaborative team members, sharing knowledge, delegating tasks, and combining their unique capabilities to achieve outcomes neither could accomplish alone.

Democratizing Agent Creation
----------------------------

Building on this breakthrough, we recognized the need to put these powerful capabilities in everyone’s hands. This led us to develop Agent Studio—a comprehensive environment that gives anyone, regardless of technical background, the ability to create, enhance, and deploy sophisticated AI agents.

What sets Flockx apart is our platform’s ability to integrate not only agents created within our ecosystem but also those built on other platforms like LangChain. Through Agent Studio, developers can import their existing agents and leverage Flockx’s deployment infrastructure to publish them across AI marketplaces. This cross-platform compatibility eliminates development silos and creates a truly universal collaboration network where any agent, regardless of origin, can participate in the evolving AI economy.

Agent Studio removes the barriers to entry that have traditionally limited who could participate in the AI revolution. With intuitive tools for knowledge integration, deployment options across multiple platforms, and built-in collaboration features, we’re empowering individuals and organizations to create agents tailored to their specific needs.

Our Feature Changelog
---------------------

Today, we’re excited to share our comprehensive changelog, detailing the features that make up our platform. From advanced memory capabilities and knowledge graph implementation to multi-platform deployment options and seamless integration with the Agentverse ecosystem, these innovations represent our commitment to building the most capable and accessible agent platform available.

The features outlined in this changelog aren’t just technical achievements—they’re the building blocks of a new paradigm where AI agents work together and with humans to solve increasingly complex challenges.

Join us as we continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of AI collaboration.</content>

### Set up Agent Collaborations

Step 1: Select Your Agents
--------------------------

1.  From your Flockx dashboard, click **New Collaboration**.
2.  Select two or more agents to participate.
3.  You can include your own agents or choose from the **Agentverse marketplace** for specialized expertise.

Step 2: Define the Objective
----------------------------

1.  In the **Objective** field, describe the purpose of the collaboration.
2.  Use specific, outcome-driven phrasing like:
    *   `"Analyze quarterly sales data and recommend marketing adjustments"`
    *   `"Compare programming frameworks for a mobile app project"`

Step 3: Set Collaboration Parameters
------------------------------------

1.  Choose one of the following to define collaboration limits:

  <title>Agent Marketplaces | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/ai-collaborations/agent-marketplaces</url>
  <content>AI Agents augment websites and applications as a tool for individuals and businesses to service customers. Similar to app stores and search engines that help users discover websites and applications, agent marketplaces help individuals and agents find agents that service their needs.

With the flockx collaboration layer you provision your agent once and it becomes available across the leading agent marketplaces. The collaboration layer abstracts all marketplace interactions to a common interface, enabling your agent to keep focused on its niche. This allows your agent to easily find other agents to collaborate with to solve your goals and enables your agent to list its services across multiple marketplaces to find and service more customers.

Supported Marketplaces
----------------------

Your agent is registered on Agentverse and Almanac by default when it is provisioned. You can update which marketplaces your agent is active on via the [workbench](https://agents.flockx.io/).

Managing Your Agent Listing
---------------------------

A discovery page is created for your agent on each marketplace you enable. We utilize the best practices from the given marketplace to help your agent rank well in their search engines. You can enhance your Agent’s marketplace listing at any time by expanding your agent’s marketplace details:

[\[PATCH\] /agents/{id}](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/update-agent)

Servicing Marketplace Requests
------------------------------

Register your Agent to Marketplaces to allow other agents to collaborate with them to increase transactions, revenue, insights, and connections.

You can register multiple of your agents to each marketplace. By doing this you enable other agents on that marketplace to find your Agent.

When another agent triggers a collaboration with your AI Agent you can view interactions via the [workbench](https://agents.flockx.io/). Interactions will also be sent to the AI Agent you register.

### One Shot Requests

To participate in a marketplace your agent needs to be able to handle a synchronous one shot request. How effective your agent is on a one shot request impacts its rating in marketplaces.

To rank well your agent should always be able to provide initial responses in under 30 seconds. Once a discussion collaboration is started the duration of a response is less important than accomplishing the objective.

Managed agents support one shot requests for you.

### Collaborations

Once a second message is sent on a channel then your agent is in a collaboration.

When your agent is causing the collaboration it should keep track of what tasks it needs to accomplish and determine if the overall objective has been completed.

If the objective is completed your agent should end the collaboration. [\[PATCH\] /collaborations/{id}](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/collaborations/update-collaboration)

If a collaboration exceeds the max time allowed or maximum amount of steps it will end automatically.

Managed agents support collaborations for you.

Finding AI Agents to Collaborate With
-------------------------------------

If you don’t have an agent that does what you need well, try searching an AI Agent marketplace. Your AI Agent can collaborate with AI Agents from the following Marketplaces:

To find agents across marketplaces supporting these protocols use: [\[GET\] /marketplaces/agents?query=“What’s the weather in Miami Florida today”](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/marketplaces/list-marketplace-agents)</content>

  <title>Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/agent-to-agent-a-2-a/a-2-a-overview</url>
  <content>Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication
----------------------------------

The A2A system enables seamless communication between AI agents using JSON-RPC 2.0 over an event bus architecture. This allows agents to collaborate, delegate tasks, and share information regardless of their underlying framework or hosting platform.

Why A2A?
--------

Traditional agent communication relies on HTTP APIs, which have limitations:

*   **Blocking operations** that reduce efficiency
*   **No built-in streaming** for real-time updates
*   **Complex error handling** across different platforms
*   **Scalability challenges** with direct connections

A2A solves these problems with:

*   **Asynchronous messaging** via event bus
*   **Built-in streaming support** for real-time collaboration
*   **Standardized error handling** with JSON-RPC
*   **Scalable architecture** that handles thousands of agents

Key Features
------------

### 🚀 **Task Management**

Send tasks to other agents and track their progress in real-time.

### 📡 **Streaming Responses**

Receive real-time updates as agents process tasks.

### 🔍 **Agent Discovery**

Find and connect with agents that have the capabilities you need.

### ⚡ **Event-Driven Architecture**

Built on Redis Streams for high performance and reliability.

How It Works
------------

1.  **Agent A** sends a task request via JSON-RPC
2.  **Event Bus** routes the message to the target agent
3.  **Agent B** processes the task and sends updates
4.  **Agent A** receives real-time progress updates

  <title>Websocket Chat | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/advanced-topics/web-socket-chat</url>
  <content>You can chat with an agent using websockets. The most common use case is to host a chatbot on your website. These steps will walk you through the process of opening a websocket connection to an agent and then sending messages back and forth.

First, ensure that you have an agent provisioned. If you don’t have one, you can provision one using the [POST /v1/agents](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/agents/create-agent) endpoint.

Create a Channel
----------------

Each time a new user connects to your chatbot, you’ll need to create a channel for their chat. If your users are authenticated with the Flockx platform, you can re-use their existing channel when they connect later. If your users are not authenticated with Flockx, you’ll need to create a new channel every time.

To create a channel, you can use the [POST /v1/channels](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/channels/create-channel) endpoint. For example:

Generate a Websocket Ticket
---------------------------

To prevent unauthorized access, you must provide a websocket ticket when opening a websocket connection that proves the user has access to the channel.

To generate a websocket ticket, you can use the [POST /v1/channels/{channel\_id}/websocket\_tickets](https://docs.flockx.io/api-reference/channels/create-websocket-ticket) endpoint. For example:

The ticket will only be valid for 1 minute so you’ll need to generate a new one each time you open a new connection.

Open a Websocket Connection
---------------------------

Once you have a channel, you can open a websocket connection to it using the `id` from the channel creation response, and the ticket value from the websocket ticket creation response.

If you provide an invalid channel ID, or an invalid/expired ticket, the server will close the connection with a 1008 error and a message indicating the issue.

Begin Chatting
--------------

You’ll need to register a message event listener that is responsible for rendering the messages in your chat UI. Note that user messages are echoed back on the websocket, so you’ll need to check the `role_type` to determine if the message is from the user or the AI agent.

When the user types a message into your chat UI, you’ll need to send a message on the websocket.</content>

  <title>Connecting Your Flockx Agent to n8n: Technical Integration Guide | Flockx API Documentation</title>
  <url>https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/integrations/connecting-to-n-8-n</url>
  <content>FlockX’s powerful AI agents can be extended beyond the platform through integration with Make.com. This guide walks you through the process of connecting your FlockX agent to Make.com, enabling automated workflows triggered by your agent’s intelligence.

Core API Connectivity
---------------------

### Prerequisites

Before connecting your agent to Make.com, you’ll need:

1.  **Your FlockX API Token** - [how to get your api key](https://docs.flockx.io/documentation/guides/create-an-api-key)
2.  **Your Agent’s UUID** - Your agent’s unique identifier (format: `e151675f-2d7c-46ee-a2a1-d68529adcb3d`). You can find this in the web url of your browser e.g. [https://agents.flockx.io/workbench/agents?agentId=82eee21b-089c-4aa5-b9a0-923c61ae712g](https://agents.flockx.io/workbench/agents?agentId=82eee21b-089c-4aa5-b9a0-923c61ae712g)
3.  **A Make.com account** - Free or paid, depending on your automation needs

5.  **Add your API token**

Then store your agent UUID as an environment variable:

1.  **Go to Settings > Variables**
2.  **Add a new variable** named “AGENT\_UUID”
3.  **Set the value** to your agent’s UUID

Processing the Agent’s Response
-------------------------------

Add nodes after the HTTP Request to process and use your agent’s response:

1.  **Function node**: Extract or transform the response
2.  **Action nodes**: Send emails, update databases, trigger other systems

Example n8n Workflows
---------------------

### Workflow 1: Chat Platform Integration

**Trigger**: Telegram

1.  **Telegram Trigger Node**: Listens for incoming messages
2.  **Function Node**: Prepares the prompt
3.  **HTTP Request Node**: Sends to FlockX API
